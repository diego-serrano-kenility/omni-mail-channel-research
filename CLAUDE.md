# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This directory is dedicated to **research purposes only**. It contains research findings, analysis, and documentation related to mail channel development and integration.

## Content Guidelines

### Allowed File Types

This directory should contain **only text-based files**:
- `.md` - Markdown files (primary format for documentation)
- `.csv` - CSV files (for data analysis and tables)
- `.txt` - Plain text files (for notes and raw data)

### Output Requirements

**All outputs generated by Claude Code MUST be in Markdown format (`.md` files).**

When creating research documents, use Markdown to:
- Document findings and analysis
- Create structured reports
- Summarize research data
- Present comparisons and evaluations
- Organize notes and observations

### File Organization

Organize research files with descriptive names that indicate their content:
- `findings-[topic].md` - Research findings
- `analysis-[topic].md` - Detailed analysis
- `comparison-[services].md` - Service/tool comparisons
- `notes-[date].md` - Research notes
- `data-[topic].csv` - Data tables

## Workflow

1. Conduct research using appropriate tools and sources
2. Document findings in well-structured Markdown files
3. Use tables, lists, and formatting for clarity
4. Keep files focused and organized by topic
5. No code files or executable content should be created here
